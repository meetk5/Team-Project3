# The Data Restaurateurs - Restaurant Finder NYC
Whether it is after a long day of work from home or a lazy weekend morning, whenever you decide to order or go out for your lunch/dinner, you are faced with a very difficult choice. You end up spending a good amount of time deciding what to eat and where to order from or where to go out.

This happens with all of us. It is called “**Choice Overload**”. Even if you decide what you want to eat, one of the biggest worries during the Pandemic is - 

“Is that restaurant following all safety protocols?”

“Is ordering food from this restaurant safe?”

We have created a website that precisely helps people find details about the restaurants in their neighborhood in NYC. Our website lets users find restaurants by cuisines in their boroughs and also mentions the violations in each borough and a list of restaurants for each violation.

We even have a “Wheel of Fortune” style visualization that’ll help users choose a cuisine and corresponding list of restaurants when they are faced with a “Choice Overload” dilemma.
